	- Destructuring: --> Expression which allows us to extract values from objects and arrays into variables.
	- To destructure values from arrays we use square brackets.
	- To destructure values from objects we use curly brackets.
	
	- The first variable declared in the brackets will receive the first array item as its value.
	- The second variable will receive the second array item as its value, and so on.
	- You can use the spread operator or three dots to replace the remaining array or object values into one variable.

	Example:
	--------

	const array = [1, 2, 3];
	const[value1] = array; //value1 = 1
	const[value1, value2] = array; //value2 = 2
	const[value1, value2, value3] = array; //value3 = 3
	const[value1, ...value3] = array //value3 = [2, 3]

	Challenge:
	----------
		. Create a function called getStudents which takes one argument (classroom).
		. classroom will contain a boolean value call hasTeachingAssistant, and classList.
		. The first value in classList will be the teacher (Rashida).  If hasTeachingAssistant is true, the second value in the classList is the teaching assistant, and the
		remaining values in the classList are the students.
		. If the hasTeachingAssistant is false, the second value through the end of the class list are the students.
		. Task --> Return a list of students.
		. You must use object and array de-structuring.

	Solution:
	---------
