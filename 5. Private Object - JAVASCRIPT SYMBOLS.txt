Private Object:
---------------

	- JavaScript symbols: New primitive data type introduced by ES6.
	- Every value returned by a symbol is unique --> This means that we can use them as identifiers (keys) for object properties.

	Challenge:
	----------
		. Create a user object that has three properties:
			. 1. Username.
			. 2. Password.
			. 3. Age.

		. Using JavaScript symbols ensure that username and password are private fields on the user character.  This means they shouldn't be accessible by calling
		user.username or user.password

	Solution:
	---------
		
private-object.js
-----------------

const username = Symbol("username");
const password = Symbol("password");

const user = {
    //username: "buchenwolf",
    //password: "1234566",
    [username]: "buchenwolf",
    [password]: "1234566",
    age: 27,
};

console.log(user.username);
console.log(user.password);

	- Symbols are extremely useful for creating private variables, and although you probably won't see them during your day to day programming, understanding what they are
	and what they are used for will really help your development skills.
