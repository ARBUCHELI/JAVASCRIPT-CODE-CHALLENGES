Food Truck
**********
	- Sets: JavaScript primitive type that allows to create a unique set of items.
	- We can use sets when we have a dataset that contains repeated values and we want to remove duplicate instances.
	
	Challenge:
	---------
		. You are building a website for a food truck festival.
		. Each vendor has a menu and some vendors may be serving the same item.
		. Given an array of food track menus, where each menu is an array, return one master menu wich contains all food items, that will be served at the festival, without
		duplicates.
		. We'll take this unique menu and use DOM manipulation to create an unordered list containing these unique menu items.
		. The index.html has an unordered list with an ID of combined-menu, that you can use to append children to.
