* URLiFY
--------
	- Strings: One of the core data types in JavaScript.  
	- The string data type comes with many utility functions which we can use to find and replace characters.

	Challenge:
	----------
		. Create a function that takes in a blog post title and returns the URL-ified version.
		. To create a URL version of a title, all punctuation must be removed, all letters must be lowercase, and all spaces must be joined by hyphens.
		. Use a combination of regular expressions and string prototype functions to complete the challenge.

	Solution:
	---------
		. First remove the punctuation using the replace function.
		. To define the set of punctuation we want to remove we can use a regular expression or regex.  To create a regex, we can use a literal notation.
		. We need to use other methods too:
			. toLowerCase()
			. trim()
			. replaceAll()
		. Just for this exercise its necessary to take into consideration that the replaceAll method is not supported in Google Chrome.

	
URLify.js
---------
function urlify(blogTitle) {
	const punctuation = /[.,/#!$%^&*;:{}=!\-_`~()'"]/g;
	
	const blogTitleWithoutPunctuation = blogTitle.replace(punctuation, "");
	return blogTitleWithoutPunctuation.toLowerCase().trim().replaceAll(" ", "-");
}

console.log(urlify("How I Got Into Programming!!!"));
console.log(urlify("I've got a new job :)"));
