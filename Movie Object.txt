* Movie object
--------------
	- Prototype chain: Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript uses objects to construct inheritance.
	Each object has a private property which links to another object.  This object is known as prototype.

	- The prototype object has a prototype of its own, and the chain continues until an object with a null prototype has been reached.

	* Challenge
          ---------
	Build a movie object which takes in five arguments:
		. Title.
		. Director.
		. Genre.
		. Release year.
		. Rating.
		
	The movie prototype should have a function called getOverview which logs the following overvies for each film:

		. "<movie>, a <genre> film directed by <director> was released in <releaseYear>.  It received a rating of <rating>."

	You can use to create your prototype, either:

		. Class syntax:
			class Movie {
			...
			}

		. Function syntax:
			function Movie() {
			}

	Once you create your movie object, create a few movies to test it out.

	- To create object using functions, we capitalize the name to indicate that this function must be called with the "new" keyword.

	- A constructor function is a blueprint for JavaScript objects.

	- Remember: To add a function to the prototype we use the constructor function name followed by the prototype keyword and lastly the name of the function we want to add.

	- We declare the function on the prototype so that each new copy or instance of the movie object doesn't recreate the function.

	- Instead of using a function, with can use the class keyword.  This class keyword is only syntactical sugar and isn't comparable to object oriented programming languages
	like Java.
