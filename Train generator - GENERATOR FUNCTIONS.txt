-Train generator
***************

	- Generators: --> Functions that can be exited, and at a later point in time, reentered while maintaining their context.
	- Generator functions used to be really great in solving problems with asynchronous programming, but recently they've kind of been replaced be JavaScript async await.
	- We declare generator functions with an asterisk following the function keyword.

	- Calling a generator function doesn't immediately execute the body of the function, instead a generator object for the function is returned.
	- We must call the iterator's next() method to hit the next yield value.
	- The next() method returns an object with a "value" property that contains the yielded value, and a "done" property which tells us whether the generator has yielded
	its last value.
	

	Challenge
	---------
		. Build a generator function that returns the next stop in a list of stops along the Metro North Railroad in New York.
		. Each time a button is clicked, the next stop in the journey should be returned until we reach Grand Central Station in New York City.
		. The train stops are:
			. Poughkeepsie.
			. Newburgh.
			. Peekskill.
			. Yonkers.
			. Bronx.
			. Grand Central.
