Coffee Calculations
*******************

	- Array.reduce(): --> Runs a function once for every item in an array and returns a single value.
	- The reduced function is a function that you provide that takes an accumulator value and a current value.
	- The accumulator value is the combined total of all previous calllback functions runs, and the current value is the current value in the array, that we are executing
	this function on.
	
	Challenge:
	----------
		. Use the reduce function to calculate the total bill from a trip to the coffee shop with your friends.
		. Each person has ordered some number of coffees and you offer to pay the entire bill.
		. Given an array of integers where each value is greater than zero, calculate the total price of all coffees.
		. Each coffee costs $1.25.
		[2, 3, 1, 5]
		Price per coffee = $1.25
		Sum of coffees = $13.75

		. Return the answer in the following format: "The total bill is ${total}"

	Solution:
	---------
		. Accumulator: current values from all previos executions: totalCoffes.
		. Current array value: numCoffees.

---------------------

function coffeeDate(coffeeArr) {
    let coffeeSum = coffeeArr.reduce(
        (totalCoffees, numCoffees) => (totalCoffees += numCoffees)
    );
    return `The total bill is $${coffeeSum * 1.25}`;
}

console.log(coffeeDate([2, 5, 7, 1, 4]));

		. The Array.reduce() method can be a little bit more performance in certain situations.  For example, insted of running array.filter method and then mapping over that new
		array, we can actually just use the Array.reduce() method once
