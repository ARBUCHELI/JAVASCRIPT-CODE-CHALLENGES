Technical Books
***************

In this challenge we are going to use inheritance to create a variation of our Book class.

	Challenge:
	----------
		. Create a TechnicalBook class that inherits from the Book class from the previous challenge.
		. This class will also take a title, author, ISBN, and number of copies, but also will take a fifth argument, an edition.
		. The TechnicalBook class will also provide a getEdition() function which returns the following string:
			. The current version of this book is ... followed by the book's edition.  You should use a template literal for this phrase.

	Solution:
	---------
		. WE USE THE extends KEYWORD TO INHERIT FROM ANOTHER CLASS:
		. We can pass the arguments of the constructor to the parent class using the keyword super.
		. We must call super before setting any of the values on the TechnicalBook class, as it calls the parent constructor with our arguments.
		. Then we can set this.edition = edition.
		. The last step is to add the getEdition() function.

class Book {
    constructor(title, author, ISBN, numCopies) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.ISBN = ISBN;
        this.numCopies = numCopies;
    }

    get availability() {
        return this.getAvailability();
    }

    getAvailability() {
        if (this.numCopies === 0) {
            return "Out of stock";
        } else if (this.numCopies < 10) {
            return "Low stock";
        }
        return "In stock";
    }

    sell(numCopiesSold = 1) {
        this.numCopies -= numCopiesSold;
    }

    restock(numCopiesRestocked = 5) {
        this.numCopies += numCopiesRestocked;
    }
}

class TechnicalBook extends Book {
    constructor(title, author, ISBN, numCopies, edition) {
        super(title, author, ISBN, numCopies);
        this.edition = edition
    }

    getEdition() {
        return `The current version of this book is ${this.edition}.`;
    }
}

const CrackingTheCodingInterview = new TechnicalBook(
    "Cracking The Coding Interview",
    "Gayle Laackmann McDowell",
    1209123,
    7,
    "2.3"
);

console.log(CrackingTheCodingInterview.availability);
console.log(CrackingTheCodingInterview.getEdition());
